       <p>
      I’m <strong>Mohammad Reza Mohammadi</strong>, an Environmental Data Scientist with a strong academic background and hands-on industry experience in environmental monitoring, remote sensing, and geospatial data science. I hold a Master’s degree in Environmental Science from Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran, where I specialized in applying data-driven approaches to solve complex environmental challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey culminated in a thesis titled <em>"Assessing Changes in Spatial Density and Emissions of Aircraft Pollutants During the Coronavirus Pandemic (2019 - 2020)."</em> This ambitious project pushed the boundaries of conventional data analysis, requiring the management and processing of over 1.8 billion records of global flight data. I built scalable pipelines using Python and high-performance libraries like NumPy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Dask, and Xarray to extract meaningful insights about pollutant emissions with spatial resolution down to the square kilometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel with my studies, I served as a research programmer and IT technician at the Data Processing Management Center of Tarbiat Modares University, where I supported interdisciplinary teams in developing research tools and optimizing data workflows. I also contributed as a teaching assistant and Python instructor, guiding students through both foundational and advanced programming concepts with environmental applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond academia, I worked as Lead Data Engineer & Analyst at Persepolis Pars Petrochemical Company, where I analyzed air pollutant trends using satellite data and geospatial models. My contributions directly informed environmental management strategies within the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m investigating the factors influencing carbon flux across Europe using data from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). This involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and ensemble model development to better understand the drivers of carbon exchange under changing climatic conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work sits at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental science. I’m passionate about using geospatial analytics, satellite imagery, and open-source tools like Google Earth Engine to address urgent global issues such as climate change, natural disasters, and environmental risk assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through every project, I aim to bridge scientific understanding with practical impact - transforming data into decisions that promote sustainability and resilience. Whether it’s through my research, teaching, or technical development, I am committed to innovation and excellence in environmental science.
